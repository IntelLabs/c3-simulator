= SPEC benchmark support

This directory provides scripts for automating SPEC benchmark runs with the
Cryptographic Computing models. They require that SPEC 2006 and/or SPEC 2017
C and C++ workloads be placed in subdirectories. Specifically, each subdirectory
should be named according to the name of the workload, with "17" appended for
SPEC 2017 workloads except those that already end in a digit. For those, "_17"
must be appended to the name. Within each subdirectory, the source code for the
SPEC workloads should be placed in a nested subdirectory named `src`.

== Running SPEC benchmarks locally

To launch SPEC benchmarks locally, use the `run_all_on_local06.sh` or
`run_all_on_local17.sh` scripts for SPEC 2006 or SPEC 2017, respectively.
Logs will be placed in `run_on_local_results06` or `run_on_local_results17`.
